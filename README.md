# Around the World in 26 Languages

[![Build Status](https://github.com/cderici/around-the-world-in-26-languages/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cderici/around-the-world-in-26-languages/actions/workflows/build.yml)


This is my collection of 26 small experimental programming languages, one for every letter of the alphabet, each named after a city and written in modern C++. (The city names have no semantic relation to the languages.)

I design the syntax, type rules, and runtimes myself, and the languages share pieces of compiler infrastructure whenever possible. Some target LLVM IR, some target PTX for CUDA experiments, some target MLIR, and some include an ORC-based JIT REPL.

This project is my space to explore ideas in language design, IR construction, optimization behavior, and runtime implementation. It will probably never be complete.
