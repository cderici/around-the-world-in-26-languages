# Around the World in 26 Languages

[![Build Status](https://github.com/cderici/around-the-world-in-26-languages/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cderici/around-the-world-in-26-languages/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This is my collection of small experimental programming languages, one for every letter of the alphabet, each named after a city and written in C++23. (The city names have no semantic relation to the languages.)

Each language explores different designs, features, or optimizations, and they share pieces of compiler infrastructure whenever possible. Some target `LLVM IR`, some target `PTX` for CUDA experiments, some target `MLIR`, and some include an LLVM ORC-based JIT repl.

This project is my space to explore ideas in language design, IR construction, optimization behavior, and runtime implementation. It's an open-ended playground, so it will probably never be fully complete.
